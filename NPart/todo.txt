FIXES
	Polygon::normal() doesnt check for valid input (actually probably no function does...)
	point in/on polygon test is wrong when the point is inside an external contour which is inside an internal one
	"Clipper error: Invalid subject np::Polygon." in YS_partitioning()
	In NPart functions, handle same input and output arguments correctly

FEATURES
	Write cell variants for functions in NPart.hpp (or use function overloading?)
	Return overlaps in YS partitioning? (Laplacian matrix)
	Make YSUQ faster by giving Polygons as optional arguments (maybe function overload?)
	Use correct scaling in NPClip (use significant digits of NPFLOAT?)
	Define << and >> for polygons (file,stream input/output)
	Write convex_hull in Polygon
	Use delaunay neighbors in V and GV
	Use mouse to move view in NPSDL

TESTS
	Test all on/in functions
	Check out the clean and other options of clipper and relevant bugs
	Save the results of YS and plot them in matlab to check for problems
	Compare clipper speed with gpc
	Add GPC wrapper and compare speed (DO NOT RELEASE THIS, PERSONAL USE ONLY)

STRUCTURE
	Write separate NPSDL functions for keyboard and mouse handling
	Find a way for cmake to always use the build/bin/lib folders (no need for the makefile)
	Make sure it works correctly as a submodule
