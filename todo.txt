Structure
    NRobot (various robot classes and control laws) [NBase, NPart]
    NPart (Partitioning algorithms) [NBase]
    NPlot (Visualization and plotting using SDL) [NBase]
    NBase (Basic geometric classes: point, contour, polygon etc.)

Classes
    Functions that require only one object (self) -> class methods
    Functions that require multiple objects -> general functions

Testing
	Contour (non) member functions
	Circle (non) member functions
Improve functions
	double n::diameter( const Polygon& P )
		use convex hull to reduce complexity
	double n::area( const Polygon& P )
		How does it handle non-simple polygons?
	n::Point n::centroid( const n::Polygon& P )
		How does it handle non-simple polygons?
