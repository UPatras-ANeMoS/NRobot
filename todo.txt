Structure
    NRobot (various robot classes and control laws) [NBase, NPart]
    NPart (Partitioning algorithms) [NBase]
    NPlot (Visualization and plotting using SDL) [NBase]
    NBase (Basic geometric classes: point, contour, polygon etc.)

Code Guidelines
	Classes
		classes contain ONLY public data members and constructors/destructors
		all other functionality is implemented as non-member functions
	Functions
		Functions that might fail MUST return an int indicating exit status
		Input arguments are either const references or values for PODs
		Output arguments are pointers

    src/NBase/*

TODO
    fix all compiler warnings
    make sure compiler adheres to strict c++ standards
    Finish in/on functions in NBase
    add plot circle(s) function
    Consistently comment every function
    make plotting more user friendly (mouse control?)
    fix licenses-dates
	add testing executables (and automated tests?)

Testing
	NBase
    NPlot
    NPart

Improve functions
	double n::diameter( const Polygon& P )
		use convex hull to reduce complexity
	double n::area( const Polygon& P )
		How does it handle non-simple polygons?
	n::Point n::centroid( const n::Polygon& P )
		How does it handle non-simple polygons?
	inpolygon
		must be in at least one external and in no internals
	info
		show compile time options (copy gol info)
